# Contraction Timer
### A small cross-platform app for timing labour contractions

#### Current version 1.0

Second ever Xamarin.Forms app ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ As the title suggests, this is a small and simple application for tracking contractions. It allows 
you to records contractions, view all your contractions in a list and delete contractions ðŸ‘¶âŒš

Here is a little GIF of the app in action (Please ignore the lag, emulating is tough work for my computer ðŸ’»ðŸ˜« and that your contractions will last *much* longer ðŸ˜…):

Like usual, please feel free to take my code and abuse it. It's defintely not the cleanest code ðŸš® but I was in a bit of a 
hurry to complete it before my wife gave birth. She hated all the other tracking apps because they were too complex ðŸ˜
